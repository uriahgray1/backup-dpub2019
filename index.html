    <div class="intro">
        Open for Public. Websites should be public parks not private homes. Websites should provide community services, local knowledge and a social network. The functions of public buildings and spaces have been replaced by Websites. Such as the Market, the Library, the School, the Stage, the Park, the Club, and the Forum. For this project, this class has developed a network of user-run public services for public good.
