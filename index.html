        OPEN FOR PUBLIC. Websites should be public parks not private homes. As the functions of public spaces have been replaced by walled off Websites, we must reclaim these common goods. Websites should provide community services, local knowledge and a social network.  Such as the Market, the Library, the School, the Stage, the Park, the Club, and the Forum. For this project, this class has developed a network of user-run public websites for public good. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 ⓓⓟⓤⓑ 2019 MADA
